Project Overview:
The goal of this project was to implement a (SIEM) solution, automate the deployment of agents, and aggregate data from Wazuh agents for visualization, CIS Benchmark compliance, and system hardening.

Objective:
* Implement a SIEM solution for enhanced security visibility and monitoring
* Automate agent deployment where ever possible 
* Aggregate data from Wazuh agents for analysis and reporting
* Visualize collected data to gain insights into network activity and potential threats or trends
* Assess compliance with CIS Benchmarks to identify and address security gaps


Results 
* Enhanced security visibility and real-time threat detection
* Simplified agent deployment and centralized management for logs
* Data analysis and insightful visualizations
* Strengthened system security posture and reduced attack surfaces base on CIS Benchmarks.      

Things needed 
-Wazuh manager agent
-Proxmox(not necessary but perfect for VMs)
-Ubuntu LXC container(suggest using a static IP)
-Windows server(Agent deployment)

Objective
Deploy and configure a containerized version of OpenVAS in Portainer to conduct a vulnerability scan against a home network, including both credentialed and non-credentialed scans. Gain insight into monitoring and defending endpoints in the home network, and plan to implement a solution like Graylog for logging. Review the system logs.


Things needed for
* Host LXC or machine
* Docker (Portainer)
* Targets (e.g., IP addresses of devices on the home network)
* Service account for credential scan


Results
* Successfully conducted vulnerability scan against the home network, including both credentialed and non-credentialed scans.
* Gained insight into monitoring and defending endpoints in the home network.
* Planned to implement a solution like Graylog for logging.
* Reviewed the system logs.
